I just released a new game. It&#8217;s (yet another) version of the popular solitaire game. I thought its name was &#8220;Chinese checkers&#8221;, but it looks like it&#8217;s most common name is &#8220;Peg&#8221;.

Another thing I always wanted to do was game programming. Moving objects and interacting with the game, as well as having fun with them, gives great satisfaction.<br />I think the fun part is that you have immediate feedback of what is happening, it&#8217;s just not like filling an edit text and pressing a button (or server side programming).<br /><br />Given that I am spending much of my spare time in (trying to) learning mobile development, I tried to merge the two things, and I came across to andengine framework.<br /><br />Andengine is an opensource framework for android game development, and it comes with a lot of nice features like physics and automatic scaling. I started developing my first game in January, and it&#8217;s a simple peg solitaire. It&#8217;s almost done but it still need to have some gui polishment (I mean I still need to have all the assets done :-) ), in any case it was a nice start. If anybody is interested, the sources are available under apache license on my github repo, which is <a href="http://github.com/fedepaol">http://github.com/fedepaol</a><br /><br />Andengine is quite powerful, but it&#8217;s main weakness is its lack of documentation. However, if you are brave enough you can look at the sources, and there is a nice forum where the author and other people give a lot of support.<br /><br />Next steps:<br /><br />One thing I still need to learn very fast, is how to perform unit tests in a game development environment, I already found a couple of links but still need to read them.<br /><br />Once I feel comfortable with TDD on games, the next step (but I am moving very slow) will be to try to implement some kind of multiplayer game (or at least a one vs one game) using all the appengine stuff I learned during my experiments.<br /><br />I will be posting again when I officially release the peg solitaire game.</div>

Well, I stopped and started thinking what&#8217;s so cool about mobile development and mobile apps, and I would like to share my thoughts.<br /><br />Before modern smartphones, most software was written to be consumed in desktop environment, where the user was sitting in front of his computer interacting with it.<br /><br />Smartphones make now easy doing something new: interacting with the environment the user belongs to. That is what I think is the most exciting thing of mobile dev. You have a bunch of information from all different sensors like gps, camera, accelerometers (and now nfc with android), and then you can mix them all and build whatever comes into your mind.<br />If this is not enough, you can even implement some service and put it somewhere in the internet, make your app a client of it and interact with other client applications.<br /><br />It now takes a reasonable amount of time to implement something that before was seen as science fiction or 007 gadgets, like video calls or augmented reality or location based service.<br /><br />I don&#8217;t mean it couldn&#8217;t be done before, but it&#8217;s not an embedded stuff nieche with custom hardware and sensors anymore. With a 200$ smartphone and a 900$ laptop, you don&#8217;t need anything else to implement a location based service with photosharing, istant messaging and all the stuff you want. And the new model of distribution makes easy to reach the users as well.<br /><br />This just from a mere technical point of view, you obviously need a good recepit to mix all the ingredients and come out with a successful product.<br /></div>

I released DroidAlone on the market in the early summer. You can find a description at the following url&nbsp;<a href="http://sites.google.com/site/droidalone/">DroidAlone - Missed call for Android</a><br />It is a paid app, and it costs something like 0.99 euros. It has been downloaded something like 150 times since then.<br /><br />I also had some issues in choosing its name: at first it was homealone, but I was afraid to Mr Culkin knokin&#8217; to my door for royalties, then it was phonealone but there was already one, and then it moved to DroidAlone. So what I suggest you is to look for your name after you choose it: you won&#8217;t have to change everything just only because you discover too late that somebody else chose the name before.<br /><br />However, today I decided to release its source files on https://github.com/fedepaol/DroidAlone/<br /><br />Why did I choose to do that? After all I spent some time working on it, and I think it&#8217;s a quite nice application.<br /><br />Well, first of all, I must be honest. The money I am getting from it is not that much, and I don&#8217;t think releasing the sources will affect my sells in a negative way. Even if it gets more popular, it would be quite hard to stop piracy. Finally, this is not my primary job, so I don&#8217;t depend on it for living.<br /><br /><br />Apart from this, there are other reasons. One of them is that the only code I wrote and made public is the one from geotagger. It was my first experiment on android and with java as well. I think I got slightly better with droidalone, and I wanted to show it.<br /><br />My android and java skills are still improving, but since I am now working with other people it will be hard to opensource the stuff I am working on now (and please remember I do android only outside my daytime job).<br /><br />So, I really hope it may help somebody, it has some nice stuff in it, like sms and call handling, and mail sending.<br /><br />So, enjoy. I&#8217;d really love to hear feedback..<br /><br />Federico</div>

This won&#8217;t be a strictly technical post, but something related to some of my impressions during android development.<br /><br />I read a lot of stuff about android, and how at first it looks so easy to deploy an android application.<br /><br />What I realized in the last year is that releasing something that &#8220;almost&#8221; work is not enough. Your app will be buried under bad reviews and, since android does not make any filter on app quality, it will just be one of the many apps out there or, even worse, it will be under below of the apps out there.<br /><br />The app must shine, and it must work like a clock. Users are (mostly) non technical people, and because of this, they just expect that everything works like a charm. Moreover, users have no mercy. If something does not work as expected, they will blame your app using any mean. On the other hand, if everything works correctly, they won&#8217;t notice it.<br /><br />How to be sure that your app will be working as expected? You can&#8217;t. What you can do is do a lot of testing, using all the tools you can find out there, like junit, and stuff like Robotium.<br /><br /><br />Another thing which is very useful is to observe people working with your app. You&#8217;ll find out some defects that you wouldn&#8217;t otherwise notice.<br /><br />Finally: pay attention to the ui. I mean, give the user a cool experience, ask help from designers. It won&#8217;t change the features of you app, nor it&#8217;s usefulness, but it will make a lot of difference.<br /><br />As a software engineer, you are unlikely to be equipped with good taste, and you will accept ugly things judging them only by they features.<br /><br />Just a final question:<br />Which of these two icons inspires you more feeling of quality?<br /><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mLncp6M6FOU/TP_yf80rfZI/AAAAAAAAE08/3gYWx-Vc9hs/s1600/first_droidalone.png"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 137px; height: 129px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_mLncp6M6FOU/TP_yf80rfZI/AAAAAAAAE08/3gYWx-Vc9hs/s320/first_droidalone.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5548419896660688274" border="0" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mLncp6M6FOU/TP_ygATEbuI/AAAAAAAAE1E/FC9N4ogfWWE/s1600/100724_Home%2BAlone_grande%2Bluce%2Balta.png"><img style="float: left; margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; cursor: pointer; width: 136px; height: 143px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_mLncp6M6FOU/TP_ygATEbuI/AAAAAAAAE1E/FC9N4ogfWWE/s320/100724_Home%2BAlone_grande%2Bluce%2Balta.png" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5548419897593458402" border="0" /></a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />I draw the first one, and then I got the second one from my favourite designer (my girlfriend).</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
It may sound weird, but I discovered java development while trying to learn android development itself.<br />Along with Java, eclipse and all this nice stuff, I discovered junit too.<br /><br />One of the problems I encountered while developing my second app, droidalone, was to test intent services.<br /><br />Intent services are a powerful way to handle background task. They basically are services that run in their own thread and die (like non sticky services) after they finished their job. They don&#8217;t have all the problems related to running an async task inside an activity (like knowing the result of the task if the activity goes in background). DroidAlone makes an intensive use of intentservices, because every event is handled by an intent service.<br /><br />A problem with testing the intent service itself (and in general, with a class that offers a &#8220;do in background, call a callback when finished&#8221; interface) is that the single test finishes when its caller function returns.  I had to find a way to make the test function hang and wait while the background service (or thread) performs its job. Then the test function has to be waken up in order to evaluate if the job result is consistent with what is expected from the test.<br /><br />The idea is pretty simple, a semaphore is locked until the task is done. When the task is done, the result is evaluated and then the semaphore is released.<br /><br />Let&#8217;s see an example.<br /><br />Here the base class to perform this actions:<br /><br /><br /><pre style="font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace;

However the basic idea is to make the test call block, and to unblock it (with a callback or with a broadcast receiver) when the task is finished.</div>

its hard to follow your code. why declare an interface. is that of type interface or did you define it yourself? where is AsyncTest defined? I&#39;m trying this myself and its not working.</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
EDIT 11/11/2012: as described in <a href="/blog/2012/11/11/android-content-providers-generator">this new blog post</a>, I modified the script to generate a content provider as well<br /><br />This is my first post about something related to android.<br />Just to break the ice, I would like to introduce a simple helper script I developed this summer.<br /><br />Android ships with a very nice local storage, which is sqllite. It&#8217;s said almost everywhere that, in order to make your life easier, you should develop an helper class.<br />It will take care of open / close the sqllite db, of the version control and of any other kind of interaction you may have with it.<br /><br />A nice example can be found in the official android documentation <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html#db">here</a><br />or <a href="http://developer.android.com/resources/samples/NotePad/index.html">here</a>.<br />Reto Meier in his excellent &#8220;Professional Android Development&#8221; explains the same, and I am pretty sure its the same for other manuals.<br /><br />Well, building a sqllite helper is BOOORING. You always have to do the same things, write the same functions of every table you want to store in it.<br />And here is where my script comes in your help.<br />You just provide it a configuration file with the description of the tables you want to store in it, and it will give you the dbhelper java file.<br /><br /><br />A configuration file looks like this:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code><br />CLASS Employee<br />String Name<br />Date Birthday<br />Double weigth<br />ENDCLASS<br /><br />CLASS Call<br />String Number<br />Date Time<br />ENDCLASS</code></pre><br /><br />The available types are<br />String, Double, Long, Integer and Date<br /><br />The available script commands are:<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code> -h, --help            show this help message and exit<br />-i INFILE, --infile=INFILE<br />                     file that contains classes definition<br />-n NAME, --name=NAME  name of the dbhelper class<br />-p PACKAGE, --package=PACKAGE<br />                     name of the package</code></pre><br /><br /><br /><br />So, instead of spending an entire afternoon writing the same add / remove / getAll methods, all you have to do is to compile the configuration file, launch something like<br /><br /><pre style="background-color: #eeeeee; border: 1px dashed rgb(153, 153, 153); color: black; font-family: Andale Mono,Lucida Console,Monaco,fixed,monospace; font-size: 12px; line-height: 14px; overflow: auto; padding: 5px; width: 100%;"><code>python sql_lite_helper.py -i sample.txt -n MyDbAdapter -p com.my.package</code></pre><br /><br />and you&#8217;ll have your brand new sqllite helper class. Of course you can extend it, for example if you want to have some insert / get methods that accept and return java classes instead of fields, but in any case it will save you a lot of time.<br /><br />An example of the output file can be found <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3092639/Archive.zip">here</a>.<br /><br />The script is available on github <a href="https://github.com/fedepaol/Android-sql-lite-helper">here</a>.<br /><br />I really hope it can help somebody. If you have any issues / requests, feel free to contact me at fedepaol[AT]gmail[DOT]com .</div>

Well, maintaining a blog looks harder than I thought, but this is another attempt to keep it alive.<br /><br />I&#8217;ll say something more about me, just to break the ice: I live in Italy, I am a software engineer, and my current employer is a company whose main products are related to finance.<br />I&#8217;m currently working to maintain and to evolve the brokerage platform of one major italian bank. After developing it&#8217;s main core components, I had the honor (?!?) of being promoted (!?) as responsible of any technical aspect of that platform. This is what I do during the day. It includes a lot of things other than coding, and I am not alone.<br /><br />However, this is not what this blog is about. This blog is about what I do in my spare time. And in my spare time, I like to learn new things.<br />It may sound weird to the most of you, but after working like 10 hours per day, I like to sit in front of my laptop and try new things (or read technical books).<br /><br />I has always been interested in mobile (as you may notice in one of the previous posts), and in the last year I started learning android development, I bought Reto Meier&#8217;s &#8220;Professional Android Development&#8221; in January and I published my first app in June. It&#8217;s quite a slow process, I know, but it was all done in my spare time (and I do sport, and I have a girlfriend as well).<br /><br />The next posts will be more technical, and will mostly involve android development.<br />Hope somebody will take advantage (or correct) and enjoy them.</div>

A lot of things have changed since my last post, but some are still the same.<br />One of them is my curiosity and my passion for technologies.<br /><br />Why I am back here? Because I am trying to understand and develop some applications with Android framework, and I think it would be useful for me to have a place where collect the new things I learn. At the same time I hope these things will be useful for somebody out there.<br /><br />I am pretty new to Java, so please cut me some slack if you find some coding horror, but at the please time tell me what I could change to write a better and more correct code.<br /><br />    Federico<br /><br /><a id="publishButton" class="cssButton" href="javascript:void(0)" target="" onclick="if (this.className.indexOf(&quot;ubtn-disabled&quot;) == -1) {var e = document['stuffform'].publish;(e.length) ? e[0].click() : e.click(); if (window.event) window.event.cancelBubble = true; return false;}"><div class="cssButtonOuter"><div class="cssButtonMiddle"><div class="cssButtonInner"><br /></div></div></div></a></div>

I often try to do something with various tech stuff. I thought that this could be a nice place to share my experiences with others, and also a good place to write everything I will need in the future.<br /><br />At the moment I am trying to work on a little project using python interpreter for symbian applications&#8230;..</div>
