During the refactoring of my two years old app DroidAlone, I decided to try to access to the storage through a ContentProvider.<br /><br />Even if the official documentation warns that there is no need to use content providers if your app does not want to export it&#8217;s data against other apps, there are a bunch of advantages in using a content provider in your app.<br /><br />The main and more obvious advantage is that you can use a Loader with your data. Using loaders relieve you from managing the cursor, forgetting open cursors here and there and most of all, makes a lot easier for your ui to react to changes in your model. Well, more than easier, you don&#8217;t have to do anything.<br /><br />However, I am not writing this post to describe how to interact with an android content provider, nor how to implement a content provider. There are a lot of content provider tutorials out there that probably can explain how them work better than I could possibly ever do (and in a better English).<br /><br />I am writing this post because while writing the content provider, I got bored.<br />It&#8217;s a lot of code, always the same, that cannot be avoided, and you don&#8217;t have to add any value to it. The best thing you can do is not getting distracted and write it with no errors. And it&#8217;s loong (ok, not that long).<br /><br />Given the &#8220;boilerplateness&#8221; of this problem, I thought I could take off some dust from my old <a href="/blog/2010/11/18/my-sqllite-helper-builder">SqliteHelper builder script</a>&nbsp;and maybe make it able to generate the content provider class for me. And that&#8217;s what I did.<br /><br /><h3>Android Content Provider Generator</h3><br /><a href="https://github.com/fedepaol/Android-sql-lite-helper">https://github.com/fedepaol/Android-sql-lite-helper</a><br /><br />I added a couple of options to it, and now it can generate automatically for you (no more cut/paste, no more forgotten columns) the content provider class AND a client class with a bunch of methods you can use to add / update / delete / query your data.<br />A sample of the generated code is already included in the beta of my app and it seems to work properly.<br /><br />I won&#8217;t write any instructions or examples here, they are already in the github repo.<br /><b>All you need to know is that with a 10 rows text file that describes your data, you can generate the whole content provider</b>.<br /><br />As <a href="https://plus.google.com/105096943850026101634/posts/RTbp2zVPZQq">I wrote on G+</a>, it&#8217;s certainly not the most elegant piece of python I wrote, but it makes it&#8217;s job.<br /><br /><br /><br />If you liked this post (or my script), consider following me on twitter @fedepaol<br /><br /></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
Here I am, back again from my third DroidconUk experience.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dfNEw8CwymY/UI7dRBZVlzI/AAAAAAAAJBw/JqUhyGTyHZE/s1600/IMG_20121029_204517.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dfNEw8CwymY/UI7dRBZVlzI/AAAAAAAAJBw/JqUhyGTyHZE/s320/IMG_20121029_204517.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />I can still remember explaining to my non tech friends what Android was the evening of the 1st droidcon, and since then it became a sort of ritual, a couple of days when I can take some rest from my day time job and take part to the community of some of the best android developers coming from all over the Europe.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YsYHqWhHMHk/UI7eDIWeCqI/AAAAAAAAJCA/b3Dv80SwVLk/s1600/IMG_20121026_190855.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YsYHqWhHMHk/UI7eDIWeCqI/AAAAAAAAJCA/b3Dv80SwVLk/s320/IMG_20121026_190855.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />It&#8217;s an (almost) cheap to flight from Pisa (IT) where I live to London, and I can always count on my architect friends from <a href="http://www.marcelmauer.eu/">Marcel Mauer</a> for accommodation.<br /><br /><br />My overall impression is that droidcon is getting better and better. It&#8217;s growing as much as the Android &nbsp;platform itself, and despite all the interesting talks the better part is still the people you can meet there BETWEEN the talks. Even if you are as shy and sociopath as I am.<br /><br /><br />Most of the talks where very instructive and I heard about a lot of new stuff I can reuse on my side projects.<br /><br /><br /><br />Here I will put a short list of what are the things I liked most (as a kind reminder for me but also for any occasional reader that lands on this page by chance).<br /><br /><br /><br /><h2>The talks:</h2><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cJwI92KmcAA/UI7hSI-I9wI/AAAAAAAAJDY/PcojASjug88/s1600/IMG_20121025_142744.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cJwI92KmcAA/UI7hSI-I9wI/AAAAAAAAJDY/PcojASjug88/s320/IMG_20121025_142744.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div><br /></div><div>I am not following a proper order if not the chronological one. I really enjoyed all the talks.</div><h3>The keynotes:</h3>It&#8217;s official. They are putting Android everywhere. Three keynotes for three Android related product which where not phones nor tablets.<br />- Ouya, the famous kickstarter funded android gaming console<br />- Vendscreen, an android based vending machine (!)<br />- Parrot android based car stereos.<br /><br /><h3>Building songkick for Android&nbsp;(<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/jdamcd/building-songkick-on-android">slides</a>):</h3>Askay and Jamie from Novoda show their professional approach to build the songkick app. A lot of interesting tips and best practices from them. Really liked the &#8220;writing good code is always faster than writing bad code&#8221; approach.<br /><br /><h3>Overcoming device fragmentation:</h3>Jan and Jon from SoundCloud had a bad time dealing with sound infrastructure in Android, especially from a multi device perspective.<br />It&#8217;s not an aspect of the platform I have never addressed that much, but I really enjoyed their story about going from the simple system call up to get the hands dirty with bringing on board ogg library through ndk. I also liked the fact that at first they tried to deal with java version, because it&#8217;s something I would do as well.<br /><br /><h3>The fly in app menu for designers and developers (<a href="https://speakerdeck.com/cyrilmottier/the-fly-in-app-menu-for-designers-and-developers">slides</a>):</h3>Cyril Mottier (&nbsp;we may remember him for Greendroid) made a gorgeous presentation on this navigation pattern which is getting more and more popular (but don&#8217;t use it just because it&#8217;s à la mode).<br />The presentation was a proper walkthrough on why and when one should use the new pattern (and when one shouldn&#8217;t). During the talk he gave a lot of tips on how the correct user experience should be. Very inspiring.<br />If you want to bring this pattern in your app and you can&#8217;t affort to develop it &#8220;in house&#8221; as Cyril did, there are a couple of libraries that implement it for us:<br /><a href="https://github.com/eddieringle/android-undergarment">https://github.com/eddieringle/android-undergarment</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu">https://github.com/jfeinstein10/SlidingMenu</a><br /><a href="https://github.com/SimonVT/android-menudrawer">https://github.com/SimonVT/android-menudrawer</a><br /><br /><br /><h3>Beaming data to devices with nfc (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/commonsguy/beaming-data-to-devices-with-nfc">slides</a>):</h3>Mark Murphy from CommonsWare introduced what (and how) can be done with an nfc enabled phone through a royalty free spy story. Interesting and funny as always, the talk of Mark is worth the ticket by itself (well, his talk and the free beers I had).<br />It&#8217;s a good starting point when I will look into nfc, which might be very soon.<br /><br /><br /><h3>Fast, user friendly and power efficient network communication with android (<a href="http://developer.sonymobile.com/downloads/documentation/fast-user-friendly-and-power-efficient-network-communication-on-android/">slides</a>):&nbsp;</h3>Another series of super tips from Erik Hellman on how you should perform networking in a proper manner.<br />Still, stuff I read here and there but still useful.<br />He also mentioned <a href="http://netty.io/">netty.io</a> library, which is something I should definitely check, since my current project involves plain socket operation and I implemented it my self (the android way).<br /><br /><br /><h3>Introduction to Google Tv (<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/OpenWorldForum/owf12paug-conf-days-google-tv-part-1-introduction-matt-gaunt-advocate-at-google">slides</a>):</h3><div>Google Tv looks to be the next big thing. I have never dig into the docs but it really looks like a new whole world. Apart from the different challenges that we can have developing a tv ui, I really like the idea of having it interact with our personal devices.</div><br /><br /><br /><h2>The libraries:</h2><br /><h3>Polaris (<a href="https://github.com/cyrilmottier/Polaris">link</a>):</h3><a href="http://android.cyrilmottier.com/">Cyril Mottier</a>&nbsp;(yes, still him) delighted us with Polaris, his map library to enhance the poor experience available from standard map apis.<br /><br /><h3>RoboSpice (<a href="https://github.com/octo-online/robospice">link</a>):</h3><div>The french guys from Octo (sorry I can&#8217;t remember the name of the speaker) presented their awesome RoboSpice library, a library to perform asynchronous jobs (and a lot more) on steroids.&nbsp;</div><div>I was really interested in this talk because of my previous attempt to build something (barely) similar with&nbsp;<a href="/blog/2012/01/postmanlib-android-and-rest-web.html">Postman Lib</a>&nbsp;. Unfortunately I never had time to polish it and it&#8217;s still an unfinished product. Moreover, the guys from Octo made a better job under every aspect of object reusing and performance, dealing with issues I would have never fix even if I took the library to a decent state. I am quite curious to dig into their code just for the fun of it :-)</div><div><br /></div><h3>OpenCv:</h3><div>Erik Hellman from Sony introduced how opencv library for computer vision can be (almost) easily integrated into an android app. Still, something I would always loved to play with, maybe I will if I get some extra spare time.</div><br /><br /><h3>NetMera (<a href="http://www.netmera.com/pages/web/home">link</a>):</h3>Well, this is not a real library, but it&#8217;s a brand new concept (at least, new to me) for a platform as an sdk. &nbsp;It was introduced by Friedger Muffke during his talk&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GjAWqrB-OrEtsoudPLMq1KUEwjSuPygHmNBjv1FEq0A/edit">&#8220;Serverless Android Applications&#8221;</a>. They provide a full remote backend without having you bother at all for it. Sounds like the holy grail for&nbsp;<i>developers with no time(tm)&nbsp;</i>but I don&#8217;t like the idea of having my code bound to a specific service.<br /><br /><br /><h2>Talks I missed:</h2><div>I was told that this talks were excellent:</div><div>- <a href="http://prezi.com/fh2uslbr1xs3/the-fragment-transition/">The fragment transition</a>&nbsp;by Corey Latislaw</div><div>- <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1OcGVS5bci9jaYiI7uvXFf9asj5TS4xZa72LX-i8lEcs/present#slide=id.p25">Writing games for an Android video game console</a>&nbsp;by Al Sutton</div><div>- Proguard by Eric Lafortune</div><div>-&nbsp;Dynamic animations with custom views by Anders Ericsson</div><br /><br /><h2>Epilogue:</h2>I had a great time at droidcon, I really enjoyed it under every aspect (even though I suspect I still have to digest an hotdog of two from the dinner of Thursday). It really boosted my hunger for learning new things. As an immediate effect I decided to polish my old apps, those I developed three years ago which now look ugly and old (the code as well).<br /><br />See you next year, DroidConUk!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yzyd64vYHrA/UI7eL43qhqI/AAAAAAAAJCI/Ua-AJTnGAu8/s1600/IMG_20121027_072842.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yzyd64vYHrA/UI7eL43qhqI/AAAAAAAAJCI/Ua-AJTnGAu8/s320/IMG_20121027_072842.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><span style="font-size: x-small;">(This picture was taken at Liverpool Street while waiting for the bus to Stanstead Airport).

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;">EDIT 17/10/2012:</span><br />Gridlayout support is now working natively with maven android deployer. I strongly suggest to use it instead of my method.<br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-large;">&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><br /></span><br /><a href="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/GridLayout.html">Gridlayout</a> has been introduced since api level 14, and is being suggested layout as a more efficient alternative over nested linear layouts and relative layout.<br /><br />It has also been recently added as part of the android support library, in order to have it available on older devices.<br /><br />Trying to use it in a maven setup is a bit tricky.<br />At the time of writing, the version added by <a href="https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer">maven android deployer</a> won&#8217;t work because of this <a href="https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer/issues/50">issue</a>&nbsp;.<br />The problem is, you can&#8217;t just add the jar because the library is intended to be an android project library, which means that brings with itself a couple of resources.<br /><br /><br />The error you might get is<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: android/support/v7/gridlayout/R$dimen</span></b><br /><br />I don&#8217;t know if the following is the best &#8220;mavenic&#8221; way to solve the problem, however it worked for me and I am sharing it here.<br /><br />What you need to do is to build your own apk lib to add to your maven repo to link against.<br /><br /><h3>Step 1: building an apk lib</h3><div>The information you can find on android maven plugin <a href="http://code.google.com/p/maven-android-plugin/wiki/ApkLib">website</a>&nbsp;wasn&#8217;t very clear to me. However they ship a couple of <a href="https://github.com/jayway/maven-android-plugin-samples/archives/stable">examples</a> you can take inspiration from.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div>Assuming that you have a proper ANDROID_HOME variable set up, and you already used maven android deployer to have a working setup, the first thing you have to do is to download the support library.&nbsp;</div><div>You will find it under $ANDROID_HOME/extras/android/support/v7/gridlayout</div><div><br /></div><div>Make your own copy somewhere else in your hard disk.</div><div><br

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<br /><br />I have been curious about intellij since droicon uk 2011, where I noticed that some of the speakers were using IntelliJ instead of eclipse.<br /><br />A <a href="https://plus.google.com/115995639636688350464/posts/CgPZkFGvbm3">post</a> from Richard Hyndman, who is a developer advocate from Google, was the final straw that pushed me to download IntelliJ and give it a try.<br /><br />The first thing an eclipse user will notice in intellij is how slick and fast compares to the behemoth which is eclipse. On the other hand, an you can feel a bit disoriented at first.<br /><br /><br />Setting up a new android project using IntelliJ is pretty straightforward. You can follow the nice tutorial from jetbrains website http://wiki.jetbrains.net/intellij/Android.<br />For this reason, I will not write about how to set up an Android project in intellij here.<br /><br /><br />What I am going to write about is how to setup an <b>android project with intellij and integrate robolectric</b> with it.<br /><br />I really like robolectric. It makes unit testing for android a lot faster as it would be on the emulator. What&#8217;s more, you can use mockito with it.<br />Mockito is a mocking framework that makes a lot easier to mock your java objects.<br />Mockito does not work with dalvik jvm, but robolectric makes your tests run on your pc&#8217;s jvm.<br /><br /><br />Despite robolectric provides instruction on how to setup an intellij project manually, I have tried that process a lot of times, carefully checking if I was missing a step.<br />However, I did not manage to get it working. The guys from Pivotal provide also an intellij starter project, which you can configure to point a git repository https://github.com/pivotal/AndroidIntelliJStarter<br /><br /><br />However, I was not either satisfied with this solution and, inspired by this <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/robolectric/QN6dskFjrHc">post</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;I tried to setup a maven solution and to import it in intellij afterwards.<br /><br />This provides another great benefit, which is the fact that I can import the same project in my linux netbook without bothering for relative paths in eclipse projects.<br /><br />So, here are the steps I had to follow in order to get it working:<br /><br />- Install the android sdk. This is trivial, I assume you are comfortable with that<br />- Let the ANDROID_HOME environment variable point the path where you uncompressed the android sdk<br />- You need to have at least one version of the sdk installed, so if you haven&#8217;t yet, you should launch the sdk manager that is the &#8220;android&#8221; executable on ANDROID_HOME/tools/android. Install also the extras, such as the compatibility library, admob stuff and all the libraries you find at the bottom<br /><br /><br />- install the maven android sdk deployer you can find at <a href="https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer">https://github.com/mosabua/maven-android-sdk-deployer </a>and then install it.<br /><br />I read somewhere that you can get android jar without relying on it, but in any case, if you need google maps or other private apis like that you still need to use this tool.<br />&nbsp;I use the latest (almost) version which is 4.0.3, so I run mvn install -P 4.0.3<br /><br /><br />- Install maven android plugin. The easiest way is to use android archetypes from here:<br />https://github.com/akquinet/android-archetypes<br /><br /><br />Finally, you are now ready to generate your first maven android project:<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />mvn archetype:generate \<br />&nbsp; -DarchetypeArtifactId=android-quickstart \<br />&nbsp; -DarchetypeGroupId=de.akquinet.android.archetypes \<br />&nbsp; -DarchetypeVersion=1.0.8 \<br />&nbsp; -DgroupId=your.company \<br />&nbsp; -DartifactId=my-android-application<br /><br /><br /><br />You <i>could</i> find an issue. &nbsp;Recently the tree of the android sdk folders has been slightly changed. Maven android plugin expects them to be in the updated version (I don&#8217;t remember what the differences where). However, if maven complains it cannot find android related stuff, and your sdk has been installed for some time, a good option would be to remove the sdk and reinstall it from scratch (at least the part you download with the sdk manager).<br /><br /><br /><br />At this point, you have a working maven project, which you could already open with intellij. What is still missing is the robolectric dependencies.<br />Nothing more easy, all you have to do is to add<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/3165830.js?file=aaa.xml"></script> right below android dependencies.  You should also create the test folder, under <i>src/test/your/package/ </i><br /><br />Now, a problem I had was that I had to change the pointer of the repository in order to have robolectric 1.2 working.<br /><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/3165854.js?file=bbb.xml"></script><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />At this point, you should be able to open the pom.xml with intellij.<br /><br /><br />Now, to have robolectric working from intellij, you still need to make a couple of changes:<br />- the order of include of jars does not respect the one you specified. What&#8217;s more, you will likely to get the STUB! error because android jar is included before junit and robolectric.<br />All you need to do is to move the android jar below junit and robolectric<br /><br />- you need to manually specify the javadocs for android. You do this by highlighting android jar, pressing the little edit in the lower left corner.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cix5eHOX7ik/UA2uDjBWp2I/AAAAAAAAHso/ctXgbFyx8Tg/s1600/intellij1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Cix5eHOX7ik/UA2uDjBWp2I/AAAAAAAAHso/ctXgbFyx8Tg/s320/intellij1.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br /><br />and pressing the plus sign. Then you choose &#8220;Attach files or directories&#8221;, point the path related to your android docs,<br />which is /docs/references under your ANDROID_HOME. Finally, you declare that it&#8217;s related to javadoc.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Now you are _almost_ ready to start. You made all this mess because you want to have robolectric working with intellij.<br /><br />You need to create, right under src/ folder, the following path:<br /><i>src/test/java/ YOUR_PACKAGE&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />where you are going to include your unit tests, and you are done!<br /><br /><br />If you liked this post, please consider following me @fedepaol .<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div><br /></div><br /><div><br /></div></div>

I added here https://dl.dropbox.com/u/3092639/pom.xml a working pom.xml I am currently using. I just tried to mvn clean install from a clean checkout and it looks to be finding robolectric. I hope you are missing something which you can correct using this example. Ping me if you can&#39;t</div>

  <div class="entry-content"><div class='post'>
<span style="font-size: large;">Edit 2013-03-10: I&#8217;ve performed a substancial refactoring of postmanlib, and the details can be found in <a href="/blog/2013/03/06/postman-ringstwice-reloaded-android">this new post</a></span><br /><br />With the development of <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas">MyDearSanta</a> app, I needed to fetch and put some data to a rest service developed using django python framework with a simple set of json based rest apis.<br /><br />The development of the interaction between <b>android and the rest web service</b> was a bit messy because I was in hurry to release the app before Christmas (giving it&#8217;s xmas related nature), but while developing it I thought it could have been a good start for my first android library. And so it was.<br /><br />Yesterday I finally managed to write a first use case of my PostmanLib (rings twice) android library. I must confess it tooks nearly a couple of hours just to get a nice name, but I really like this one.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;">You can check the library <a href="https://github.com/fedepaol/PostmanLib--Rings-Twice--Android">HERE</a></span><br /><br />It&#8217;s barely inspired by Virgil Dobjanschi talk at google io 2010, and its relies on the common pattern is to make the one-shot background work inside intent services, let them update the model with the results of their work and then notify the interface when the model it&#8217;s changed, so that it can refresh itself.<br /><br />It does not provide a way to serialize your data into <b>json</b> nor how to store it into a content provider. There are a plenty of examples out there if you look for <u>json, android, rest</u> and other keyword like those and what&#8217;s more, they really depends on the interface your server is offering.<br /><br />What was missing was a common and clean way to interact with the service without using the &#8220;asynctask inside an activity&#8221; approach, which I don&#8217;t really like because of the well known issues of&nbsp;configuration changes.<br /><br />All you need to do with my lib is to implement the abstract methods of a Command class, such as the execute method that will be called inside the intentservice which is the method that performs the real work, and some method to serialize / deserialize the command inside an intent.<br />The library comes along with a singleton helper class that can be used in activities to fire the commands and get notified with their results.<br /><br />The steps are:<br /><br /><ul><li>the activity gets a reference to the helper</li><li>a command is sent to the intent service (serialized in an intent)</li><li>the intent service executes the command and updates the model (sqlite, shared prefs, content provider, whatever)</li><li>if the activity was registered as event listener, gets notified of the result and can check again the model (or notify the user about an error)</li><li>the activity can ask the helper about any in progress services (it can be useful in onresume stage to notify the user)</li></ul><div><br /></div><div>You will still have to implement the real <b>interaction between Android and the web service</b></div><br /><br />&nbsp;It&#8217;s far from be completed, but I am really enjoying how it is growing, and I hope it might be of some help for somebody.<br /><br />If you are curious about that, just checkout it from github here&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/fedepaol/PostmanLib--Rings-Twice--Android">Android rest service interaction</a></div>

This time, while PastTimer has not been released yet, I started an experiment with an old friend. We wanted not just to release another standalone app, but interact in some way with a backend.<br /><br />The result is&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mydearsanta.info/">www.mydearsanta.info</a>&nbsp;, a web based Christmas list, which comes together with and Android app&nbsp;<a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas">https://market.android.com/details?id=com.smokingbytes.santas</a>&nbsp;and an Iphone app (currently under the approval process) .<br /><br />The backend was written using the Django framework, and the apps interact with it using a json based rest api.</div>

Pastimer is my 4th app. It&#8217;s a simple (but nice) Android Kitchen Timer based on barcode scanning.<br /><br />I learned some things during my journey of android development, but this time I wanted to focus on user interface and ease of use.<br /><br />As always, it starts as a simple idea, the you start putting some code in it, it&#8217;s &#8220;almost&#8221; working, and the difference between almost working and finished, is something like two months or more. I let it alone for more than two months.<br /><br />However, now it almost ready to be released, and it will very soon.<br /><br />The idea behind it is very simple.<br /><br />You point the barcode, the app looks in its internal database, and if it does know the time associated, starts a timer. If it does not recognize the barcode, it prompts the user asking to put the data.<br /><br />Sounds easy, doesn&#8217;t it? You can give a look at a couple of screenshots here&nbsp;<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/pastimerand/">Android Kitchen Timer</a></div>

Apart from some rest, and reading some good books (like excellent Kent Beck&#8217;s Test Driven development by example, and &#8220;growing object-oriented software guided by tests&#8221;), I have been working on a new app in the last month or so.<br /><br />A week end locked at home because my gf was ill, was a good excuse to start a deep programming session. The app I am about to release (well, to be honest it still lacks all the nice ui parts, it just look like a bunch of grey buttons thrown on the screen) solves (or at least tries to simplify) a problem I have every time I need to cook pasta.<br /><br />Basically, if you need to cook some pasta (but this applies to every other boxed product), you need to put it in the boiling water and then look for the boiling time on the box, and set the timer with minutes and seconds on your phone.<br /><br />With my app you simply point the camera to the barcode of the box, and it automatically start a countdown for the right amount of time. Of course some data entry is needed, and if the barcode is not in the internal storage, the user will be asked to fill the name of the pasta and the correct boiling time.<br /><br />So, it&#8217;s a simplified timer for android, which should make easier and faster the countdown setting process.<br /><br />I really hope to release it soon, if you are interested and you want to be notified when I will release it, just throw me an email at fedepaol <at> gmail.com</at></div>
