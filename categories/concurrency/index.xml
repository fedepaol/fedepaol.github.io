      <description>There are some scenarios where the order matters Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you have an api that can receive &amp;ldquo;actions&amp;rdquo; to be performed on a given endpoint.
Think about you buying something on Amazon and then changing your mind and revoking your order. You don&amp;rsquo;t want those two actions to be swapped, otherwise the cancellation will be refused (the order you want to cancel do not exists yet) and then the item you don&amp;rsquo;t want anymore will be ordered (since the action of ordering the item receives the backend after the cancelation).</description>
