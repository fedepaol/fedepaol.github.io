      <description>It may sound weird, but I discovered java development while trying to learn android development itself.
Along with Java, eclipse and all this nice stuff, I discovered junit too.
One of the problems I encountered while developing my second app, droidalone, was to test intent services.
Intent services are a powerful way to handle background task. They basically are services that run in their own thread and die (like non sticky services) after they finished their job.</description>
