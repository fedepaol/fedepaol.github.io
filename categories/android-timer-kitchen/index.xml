      <description>Pastimer is my 4th app. It&#39;s a simple (but nice) Android Kitchen Timer based on barcode scanning.
I learned some things during my journey of android development, but this time I wanted to focus on user interface and ease of use.
As always, it starts as a simple idea, the you start putting some code in it, it&#39;s &#34;almost&#34; working, and the difference between almost working and finished, is something like two months or more.</description>
